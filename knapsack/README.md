These are to host my attempts at solving the 0/1-knapsack problem.

For some more context on the exhaustive one I made (18 November 2024), I made it
without fully looking at / comprehending the pseudocode shown in an Algorithm
Engineering class I took in Fall 2024. Just a brief bout of inspiration caused me
to make it and, surprisingly, it works in the expected time for an exhaustive
solution to this problem. You can see the file itself for more information.

The dynamic approach is soon to follow...
